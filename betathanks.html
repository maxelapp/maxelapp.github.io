      <p class="lead">Hello there!</p>
      <p>I first started this project two years ago as a personal tool, since I was dissatisfied with the existing download accelerators for Mac OS X. I wanted something native, fast, and fun to use.</p>
      <p>Two years later I've finally arrived at something I'm proud to call version 1.0.</p>
      <p>But development won't stop there. With your beta feedback (not too late to <a href="http://bit.ly/1nt7Tqz">leave some!</a>) I have a roadmap for an exciting v1.1, which will have features like <a href="https://github.com/unregistered/Maxel/issues/6">Automatic download mode</a> (no more need to specify a connection count) and a <a href="https://github.com/unregistered/Maxel/issues/7">Safari extension</a>.</p>
      <br/>
      <p class="lead">Why buy Maxel?</p>
      <p>While the beta copy will continue to work, all further development will happen within the App Store version. By buying Maxel, you'll get:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic updates for awesome features as soon they come</li>
        <li>The warm fuzzy feeling from supporting indie devs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And as a thank you to beta testers and early adopters, Maxel is <strong>50% off</strong> of its normal $7.99 price on the Mac App Store. This price lasts for the month of March only, so be sure to get it now!</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Chris (aka unregistered)</p>
