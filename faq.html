  <div class="question">How do I add a download?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>There are many ways to initiate new downloads:</p>
    <h4>1. Drag &amp; Drop</h4>
    <p>The easiest is to highlight text containing links in your browser (like Safari) and then drag this text into Maxel's dock icon or window.</p>
    <h4>2. Using the Ad Sheet</h4>
    <p>You could also press Command + N (âŒ˜N) in Maxel to open the Add Sheet. <a href="/add-sheet.html">Click</a> for more details on the Add Sheet.</p>
    <h4>3. Extensions for your Browser</h4>
    <p>Many users use one of Maxel's <a href="/browsers.html">browser extensions</a>, which provide even easier ways to add downloads.</p>
    <h4>4. Using the Built-in Browser</h4>
    <p>Downloads which require a login to access can be started from Maxel's <a href="/builtin-browser.html">Built-in Browser</a>. Or, you can use the built-in browser if you have many downloads you want to start. Any downloads initiated from the built-in browser are automatically downloaded through Maxel.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="question">Maxel says my download doesn't support multipart connections</div>
  <div class="answer">Not all servers support multipart downloading. Some services restrict this capability to paid memberships, or may disable it entirely to save bandwidth. In this case, Maxel will revert back to a normal, single connection download which isn't resumable. If you have a download which Maxel won't split which it should, email me with a link and I'll take a look: <a href="mailto:support@maxelapp.com">support@maxelapp.com</a></div>
  <div class="question">I'm not seeing my download speed improve?</div>
  <div class="answer">Maxel will only increase your speeds up to the bandwidth of your computer's connection. So if you have a 3 Mbps cable connection, that's the fastest you'll go. But in this case, Maxel will help if the server you're downloading from will only give you 300 kbps&mdash;just crank up the threads to 10, and you should get about 3 Mbps.</div>
  <div class="question">Maxel gets slow when I use 100+ connections?</div>
  <div class="answer">At this point you're not gaining speed due to the overhead of establishing each connection. Try reducing the number of connections to 10 and work your way up from there.</div>
  <div class="question">Why does my SFTP download fail with > 10 connections?</div>
  <div class="answer">The error message is: "Failure establishing SSH session. You may have too many connections..." The SSH server probably defaults to a maximum of 10 connections. To increase it, modify sshd_config (usually /etc/sshd/sshd_config) and delete the line if it exists:<br>
  <pre>MaxStartups 10:30:60</pre><br>
  Add the line<br>
  <pre>MaxStartups 100:30:160</pre><br>
  This will allow you to establish up to 100 connections simultaneously.

  <div class="question" id="API">How can I add downloads programatically?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Maxel responds to the maxel:// protocol. See <a href="/api.html">API help</a> for details.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">Maxel doesn't open when I intercept or initiate a download from a browser extension</div>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Sometimes LaunchServices messes up and fails to target Maxel. This can happen if you upgraded from the demo and kept both apps, or have multiple copies of Maxel on your computer.</p>

    <p>First, make sure to remove the Demo if you still have it, and make sure Maxel.app is installed in your Applications folder.</p>

    <p>If that doesn't work, try resetting the LaunchServices database. In 10.9:</p>
    <pre>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user</pre>
