      <p class="lead">Hello there!</p>
      <p>I first started this project two years ago as a personal tool, since I was dissatisfied with the existing download accelerators for Mac OS X. I wanted something native, fast, and fun to use.</p>
      <p>By using this demo, you've gotten a glimpse of what Maxel can do.</p>
      <p>But development won't stop here. With your feedback, I have a roadmap for an exciting v1.1, which will have features like <a href="https://github.com/unregistered/Maxel/issues/6">Automatic download mode</a> (no more need to specify a connection count).</p>
      <br/>
      <p class="lead">Why buy Maxel?</p>
      <p>While the demo copy will continue to work, all further development will happen within the App Store version. By buying Maxel, you'll get:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to Maxel's full feature set</li>
        <li>Automatic updates for awesome features as soon they come</li>
        <li>The warm fuzzy feeling from supporting indie devs</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Chris (aka unregistered)</p>
